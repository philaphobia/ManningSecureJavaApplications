## Help with Eclipse
Many Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools are available for coding in Java, so pick the one you have used before. For this project, we use Eclipse. A resource link is provided below if you are interested in learning the basic workflow of how to use Eclipse. You will need the Java EE version of Eclipse to open the project. Import the project into Eclipse. If the project complains about the JRE library, you can following these steps to fix the issue:
